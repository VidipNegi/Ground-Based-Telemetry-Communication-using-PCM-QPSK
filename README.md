Ground-Based Telemetry Communication System

This project simulates a ground-based telemetry communication system using Pulse Code Modulation (PCM) and Quadrature Phase Shift Keying (QPSK). Developed as an academic project, the system demonstrates how digital modulation techniques can improve data integrity and noise resistance in terrestrial communication links.

The repository contains the Scilab code and a detailed project report outlining the methodology, system architecture, and performance analysis.
Features

    PCM Encoding & Decoding: Simulates the digitization of analog sensor data for transmission.

    QPSK Modulation: Implements QPSK with Gray coding to enhance spectral efficiency and noise immunity.

    AWGN Channel Simulation: Models a realistic noisy communication environment using Additive White Gaussian Noise.

    Performance Evaluation: Calculates and compares the Bit Error Rate (BER) and Mean Squared Error (MSE) for both PCM-only and PCM+QPSK systems.

Project Overview

The core of this project is a comparative study between a baseline PCM system and an enhanced system that incorporates QPSK modulation. Through simulation, the project proves that adding QPSK significantly reduces the BER and MSE, resulting in more reliable data transmission in noisy conditions.
Technologies Used

    Scilab: All simulations and data analysis were conducted using Scilab, an open-source numerical computation package.
